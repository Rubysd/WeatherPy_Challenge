# WeatherPy_Challenge

The goal of this challenge is that using the Google Maps Directions API you have to create a travel route between the four cities, as well as a marker layer map.

There are several options to interact with the maps, but in this case we are going to choose one that connects the Google Maps servers so that we can see our location on our website.

Maps: We will be able to see the world and of course our business in an agile and personalized way. We will find static and dynamic maps and even 360ยบ views.

Routes: We will be able to find the best way to go from one place to another with real-time traffic updates.

Places: Helps users discover the world around them. Plan a trip, find a restaurant

For the second deliverable, input statements were delivered to retrieve the customer's climate preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then display those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

For the last deliverable, the Google Directions API was used to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the client's possible travel destinations. Next, a marker layer map was created with a pop-up marker for each city in the itinerary.
